## üöÄ TorBox Open Source
While TorBox is primarily a freeium cloud product, TorBox is also (going to be) a free self-hosted torrent client, that you can install on any machine(s) and have almost the same features as the hosted TorBox app.  

**We plan to offer the following:**
- An open source UI
- An open source backend/api
- Docker images for all items including compose images
- Instructions and Support
- Useful tools and code that TorBox uses

Making FOSS is time consuming and expensive. Please be patient with TorBox. *There is no estimate on when these items will come (if ever).*

## üëÄ Demo

You can use TorBox right now for free at https://torbox.app.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

You can follow TorBox development at [FeatureBase](https://torbox.featurebase.app/). This includes changelogs for the hosted version of TorBox as well as feedback and a roadmap.

Open source documentation can be found [here - NOT READY YET -](https://docs.torbox.app). If you are looking for information or support on the hosted version of TorBox, you can find it [here](https://support.torbox.app).

If you want to help with development, you are more than welcome to clone any of our current repositories and make a PR.

TorBox follows *Conventional Commits* format which allows our CI and repos to be organized. Any Pull Request commits not following the format will be rejected. If you want to learn more about Conventional Commits, please go [here](https://conventionalcommits.org)

## üìú License

Please be aware, that most items in the TorBox Github Organization are licensed under the *Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)*. This allows individuals to do whatever they want with the code, including self-hosting (which is literally the point) but prevents you from hosting this for others as a managed service (basically trying to rip off or copy the officially hosted version of [TorBox](https://torbox.app)). This is mainly for the safety of TorBox so nobody creates a competitor service based off of our own open source projects. ELv2 allows TorBox to stay safe, while giving the community power at the same time. Anything not marked with the ELv2 license is MIT. You can view the license [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TorBox-App/.github/main/LICENSE).
